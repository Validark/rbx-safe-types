	/** Determines if an `Instance` can be cloned using `/Instance/Clone` or saved to file.

This property determines whether an object should be included when the game is published or saved, or when `Instance/Clone` is called on one of the objects ancestors. Calling Clone directly on an object will return nil if the cloned object is not archivable. Copying an object in Studio (using the ‘Duplicate’ or ‘Copy’ options) will ignore the Archivable property and set Archivable to true for the copy.

```
local part = Instance.new("Part")
print(part:Clone()) --&gt; Part
part.Archivable = false
print(part:Clone()) --&gt; nil
``` */
	Archivable: boolean;
	/** A non-unique identifier of the `Instance`.

This property is an identifier that describes an object. Names are not necessarily unique identifiers however; multiple children of an object may share the same name. Names are used to keep the object hierarchy organized, along with allowing scripts to access specific objects.

The name of an object is often used to access the object through the data model hierarchy using the following methods:

```
local baseplate = workspace.Baseplate
local baseplate = workspace["Baseplate"]
local baseplate = workspace:FindFirstChild("BasePlate")
```

In order to make an object accessible using the dot operator, an object’s Name must follow a certain syntax. The objects name must start with an underscore or letter. The rest of the name can only contain letters, numbers, or underscores (no other special characters). If an objects name does not follow this syntax it will not be accessible using the dot operator and Lua will not interpret its name as an identifier.

If more than one object with the same name are siblings then any attempt to index an object by that name will return the only one of the objects found similar to `Instance/FindFirstChild`, but not always the desired object. If a specific object needs to be accessed through code, it is recommended to give it a unique name, or guarantee that none of its siblings share the same name as it.

Note, a full name showing the instance’s hierarchy can be obtained using `Instance/GetFullName`. */
	Name: string;
	/** The Parent property determines the hierarchical parent of the `Instance`. The following terminology is commonly used when talking about how this property is set:

- An object is a **child** (**parented to**) another object when its Parent is set to that object.
- The **descendants** of an `Instance` are the children of that object, plus the descendants of the children as well.
- The **ancestors** of an `Instance` are all the objects that the Instance is a descendant of.



It is from this property that many other API members get their name, such as `Instance/GetChildren|GetChildren` and `Instance/FindFirstChild|FindFirstChild`.

The `Instance/Remove|Remove` function sets this property to nil. Calling `Instance/Destroy|Destroy` will set the Parent of an `Instance` and all of its descendants to `nil`, and also **lock** the Parent property. An error is raised when setting the Parent of a destroyed object.

This property is also used to manage whether an object exists in the game or needs be be removed. As long as an objects parent is in the `DataModel`, is stored in a variable, or is referenced by another objects property, then the object remains in the game. Otherwise, the object will automatically be removed. The top level `DataModel` object (the one referred to as the `game` by scripts) has no parent, but always has a reference held to it by the game engine, and exists for the duration of a session.

Newly created objects using `Instance.new` will not have a parent, and usually will not be visible or function until one is set. The most elementary creation of an object has two steps: creating the object, then setting its parent.

```
-- Create a part and parent it to the workspace
local part = Instance.new("Part")
part.Parent = workspace
-- Instance new can also take Parent as a second parameter
Instance.new("NumberValue", workspace)
```

# Object Replication

An object created by server will not replicate to clients until it is parented to some object that is replicated. When creating an object then setting many properties, it’s recommended to **set Parent last**. This ensures the object replicates once, instead of replicating many property changes.

```lua
local part = Instance.new("Part") -- Avoid using the second parameter here
part.Anchored = true
part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("Really red")
-- Potentially many other property changes could go here here...
-- Always set parent last!
part.Parent = workspace
```

However, if you were parenting your parts to a `Model` whose parent hasn’t been set yet, then setting the parent first would not matter as the model would not have replicated yet. */
	Parent?: Instance;
	/** This function destroys all of an `Instance`'s children.

As `Instance/Destroy` also calls itself on the children of an object it is used on, this function will destroy all descendants.

## Alternatives to ClearAllChildren

If the developer does not wish to destroy all descendants, they should use `Instance/GetChildren` or `Instance/GetDescendants` to loop through an object and select what to destroy. For example, the following code sample will destroy all parts in an object.

```
for _, instance in pairs(object:GetDescendants()) do
	if instance:IsA("BasePart") then
		instance:Destroy()
	end
end
``` */
	ClearAllChildren(): void;
	/** Sets the `Instance/Parent` property to nil, locks the `Instance/Parent` property, disconnects all connections and calls Destroy on all children. This function is the correct way to dispose of objects that are no longer required.

When called on an `Instance` that is not a descendant of the `DataModel`, this function considers all ancestors up to and including the topmost one without a `Instance/Parent|Parent`.

This function is useful for logging and debugging. You shouldn’t attempt to parse the returned string for any useful operation; this function does not escape periods (or any other symbol) in object names. In other words, although its output often appears to be a valid Lua identifier, it is not guaranteed. */

It’s generally a good idea to use this method instead of a connection to `Changed` with a function that checks the property name. Subsequent calls to this method on the same object with the same property name return the same event.

`print(object:GetPropertyChangedSignal("Name") == object:GetPropertyChangedSignal("Name")) --&amp;gt; always true`

`ValueBase` objects, such as `IntValue` and `StringValue`, use a modified `Changed` event that fires with the contents of the `Value` property. As such, this method provides a way to detect changes in other properties of those objects. For example, to detect changes in the `Name` property of an `IntValue`, use `IntValue:GetPropertyChangedSignal("Name"):Connect(someFunc)` since the `Changed` event of `IntValue` objects only detect changes on the `Value` property. */

See also, `Instance/IsAncestorOf`. */

	/** Fires when the `Instance/Parent` property of the object or one of its ancestors is changed.

This event includes two parameters, *child* and *parent*. *Child* refers to the `Instance` whose `Instance/Parent` was actually changed. *Parent* refers to this `Instance`'s new `Instance/Parent`.

A common use for this function is detecting when an object has been removed or destroyed (using `Instance/Destroy`). This is done by checking if the parent has been set to nil. For example:

```
object.AncestryChanged:Connect(function(_, parent)
	if not parent then
		print("object destroyed!")
	end
end)
``` */

The Changed event fires right after most properties change on objects. It is possible to find the present value of a changed property by using `object[property]`. To get the value of a property before it changes, you must have stored the value of the property before it changed.

If you are only interested in listening to the change of a specific property, consider using the `GetPropertyChangedSignal` method instead to get an event that only fires when a given property changes.

This event does not fire for physics-related changes, like when the `CFrame`, `Velocity`, `RotVelocity`, `Position`, `Orientation` and `CFrame` properties of a `BasePart` change due to gravity. To detect changes in these properties, consider using a physics-based event like `RunService.Stepped` or `BasePart.Touched`. A while-true-do loop can also work.

For “-Value” objects, this event behaves differently: it only fires when the `Value` property changes. See individual pages for `IntValue&lt;` */
	readonly Changed: RBXScriptSignal<(property: string) => void>;
	/** Fires when an object is parented to this `Instance`.

Note, when using this function on a client to detect objects created by the server it is necessary to use `Instance/WaitForChild` when indexing these object’s descendants. This is because the object and its descendants are not guaranteed to replicate from the server to the client simultaneously. For example:

```
workspace.ChildAdded:Connect(function(child)
	-- need to use WaitForChild as descendants may not have replicated yet
	local head = child:WaitForChild("Head")
end)
```

Note, this function only works for immediate children of the `Instance`. For a function that captures all descendants, use `Instance/DescendantAdded`.

See also, `Instance/ChildRemoved`. */
	readonly ChildAdded: RBXScriptSignal<(child: Instance) => void>;
	/** Fires when a child is removed from this `Instance`.

Removed refers to when an object’s parent is changed from this `Instance` to something other than this `Instance`. Note, this event will also fire when a child is destroyed (using `Instance/Destroy`) as the destroy function sets an object’s parent to nil.

This function only works for immediate children of the `Instance`. For a function that captures all descendants, use `Instance/DescendantRemoved`.

See also `Instance/ChildAdded`. */
	readonly ChildRemoved: RBXScriptSignal<(child: Instance) => void>;
	/** Fires when a descendant is added to the `Instance`.

As DescendantAdded fires for every descendant, parenting an object to the `Instance` will fire the event for this object and all of its descendants individually.

Developers only concerned with the immediate children of the `Instance` should use `Instance/ChildAdded` instead.

See also `Instance/DescendantRemoving`. */
	readonly DescendantAdded: RBXScriptSignal<(descendant: Instance) => void>;
	/** DescendantRemoving fires **immediately before** the `Instance/Parent|Parent` of a descendant of the `Instance` changes such that the object is no longer a descendant of the Instance. `Instance/Destroy|Destroy` and `Instance/Remove|Remove` change an object’s Parent to nil, so calling these on a descendant of an object will therefore cause this event to fire.

Since this event fires before the the descendant’s removal, the Parent of the descendant will be unchanged, i.e., it will still be a descendant at the time of this event firing. If the descendant is also a child of the object, It will also fire before ChildRemoved. There is no similar event called “DescendantRemoved”.

If a descendant has children, this event fires with the descendant first followed by its descendants.

## Example

The example below should help clarify how DescendantRemoving fires when there are several objects involved.

![A cropped screenshot of the Explorer window. A Model contains ModelA and ModelB, which each contain a Part, PartA and PartB respectively. PartA contains a Fire object named FireA.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5bedf8a8a79094cd2b6a1c41/DescendantRemoving2.png)

- Calling `Instance/Remove|Remove` on **PartA** would cause DescendantRemoving to fire on both **ModelA** and **Model**, in that order.
- Setting the `Instance/Parent|Parent` of **PartA** to **ModelB** would cause DescendantRemoving to fire on **ModelA** but not **Model** (as Model would still be an ancestor of PartA).
- Calling `Instance/Destroy|Destroy` on **ModelA** would cause DescendantRemoving to fire multiple times on several objects: 1. On **Model** with **ModelA**, **PartA** then **FireA**.
    2. On **ModelA**, with **PartA** then **FireA**.
    3. On **PartA** with **FireA**.

    




## Warning

This event fires with the descendant object that is being removed. Attempting to set the `Instance/Parent|Parent` of the descendant being removed to something else **will fail** with the following warning: “Something unexpectedly tried to set the parent of X to Y while trying to set the parent of X. Current parent is Z”, where X is the removing descendant, Y is the ignored parent setting, and Z is the original parent of X. Below is an example that demonstrates this:

```
workspace.DescendantRemoving:Connect(function(descendant)

To learn more about using this function, see **Animation Events** in the `articles/using animation editor|Using the Animation Editor` article.

## Using the Returned Event

The RBXScriptSignal (event) returned by this can be connected to another function. The connection creates a `DataType/RBXScriptConnection` listener that executes the connected function every time the animation hits the specified KeyframeMarker until disconnected using Disconnect().

## More about Keyframes

`Keyframe` names do not need to be unique. For example, if an Animation has three keyframes named “Particles” the connected event returned by this function will fire each time one of these keyframes is reached.

`Keyframe` names can be set in the Roblox Animation Editor when creating or editing an animation. They cannot however be set by a `Script` on an existing animation prior to playing it.

## Beams and ColorSequences

This property is a `DataType/ColorSequence`, allowing the color to be configured to vary across the length of the `Beam`. Take for example the following `DataType/ColorSequence`.

```
local colorSequence = ColorSequence.new({
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0, Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)), -- red

Applying this `DataType/ColorSequence` to a `Beam` would yield the following result:

![enter image description here](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt44487f7a1e259ab2/BeamColor.png)

Note the `Beam`'s coloration also depends on the number of `Beam/Segments` the `Beam` has. Each segment of the beam can only show a transition between two colors. Therefore a `Beam` will need to have at least n-1 segments in order for the color to display correctly, where n is the number of `DataType/ColorSequenceKeypoint`s in the `DataType/ColorSequence` */

```

## Beam Curvature

Beams are configured to use a cubic [Bézier curve](). This means they are not constrained to straight lines, and the curve of the beam can be modified by changing CurveSize0, `Beam/CurveSize1` and the orientation of the beam’s `Attachment`s.

Cubic Bézier curves are formed of four control points. They are determined as follows:

- **P0**: The start of the beam, the position of `Beam/Attachment0`
- **P1**: CurveSize0 studs away from `Beam/Attachment0`, in `Beam/Attachment0`'s positive X direction.
- **P2**: `Beam/CurveSize1` studs away from `Beam/Attachment1`, in `Beam/Attachment1`'s negative X direction.
- **P3**: The end of the beam, the position of `Beam/Attachment1`



The beam starts at P0, goes towards P1, and arrives at P3, from the direction of P2. The beam will not necessarily pass through P1 and P2.

Pictured below are two sets of overlapping `Beam`s. The right one has its LightEmission set to 1, so the texture appears brighter due to the additive blending on the overlaps.

![enter image description here][1]

For more information on how a `Beam` is configured to curve, see the page for `Beam/CurveSize0`.

## Beam Segments with Color and Transparency

The `Beam/Color` and `Beam/Transparency` properties require a certain number of segments to display correctly. This is because each segment can only show a transition between two colors or transparencies. Therefore a `Beam` requires at least n-1 segments to display correctly, where n is the number of keypoint associated with the `Beam`'s `Beam/Color` and `Beam/Transparency`.

## Beam texture behavior

How a `Beam|Beam's` texture scales or repeats is dependent on the `Beam/TextureMode` property.

When `Beam/TextureMode` is ‘Wrap’ the size of the repeating texture is equal to TextureLength in studs. For an example of this see the image below:

When `Beam/TextureMode` is set to ‘Stretch’ however the texture will be stretched relative to the beam’s length. The size of the texture relative to the `Beam`'s length will be one over the TextureLength. In practice, this means the texture will repeat TextureLength times.

The offset of a `Beam`s texture cycle represents the progress of the `Beam`s texture animation. Hence, a `Beam`'s texture cycle can be reset as follows:

```
beam:SetTextureOffset(0)
```

Where manual control is not required over the `Beam`'s texture cycle, `Beam/TextureSpeed` can be used instead to animate the `Beam`. Although, for illustrative purposes, a similar function can be achieved with SetTextureOffset.

```

while true do
	for i = 1, 0, -0.01 do
		RunService.RenderStepped:Wait()
		beam:SetTextureOffset(i)
	end	
end
```

## Notes

- The given offset parameter is expected to be a value between 0 and 1, but greater values can still be used
- The texture cycle wraps at 0 and 1, meaning the texture is in the same position when the offset is 0 or at 1
- If the `Beam/Texture` property is not set, this function will do nothing
- Increasing the offset will act in the inverse direction to the `Beam/TextureSpeed` property. Meaning, it will move the texture in the opposite direction to the direction the texture animates when `Beam/TextureSpeed` is more than 0 */

For this property, the direction of the vector is the axis of rotation. The magnitude is the angular velocity in **radians per second**. By default, this property is `(0, 2, 0)`.

**Tip:** You can multiply a `DataType/Vector3` by `math.rad(360)`, or **2π**, in order to convert [angular frequency]() (rotations per second) into the desired [angular velocity]() (radians per second). For example: Setting `BodyAngularVelocity/AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity` to `Vector3.new(0, 1, 0) * math.rad(360)` ≈ `Vector3.new(0, 6.283, 0)` will cause a part to spin around the Y axis once per second.

To better understand how the axis of rotation is determined from this property, imagine that there is an axle running between the part’s position and the part’s position plus this property as a global offset. This axle determines in what orientation the object will spin. The length of the axle determines the angular speed in radians per second. In the animation below, the `Part` contains a `BodyAngularVelocity` and is floating in the air (using a `BodyPosition`). The `BodyAngularVelocity` has the default AngularVelocity of `(0, 2, 0)`, and this vector is visualized with a superimposed green line. It represents the axis of rotation. If we were to make the axle longer, like `(0, 4, 0)`, the part would spin faster.

Some transformations, such as the rotation of the head when using VR devices are not reflected in this property. For this reason, developers should use `Camera/GetRenderCFrame` to obtain the ‘true’ `DataType/CFrame` of the `Camera`.

## How to set the Camera’s CFrame

You can move the `Camera` by setting the CFrame property. However, the default [camera scripts]() also set the CFrame property. When manually setting the CFrame property, it may be overwritten by the [camera scripts]() which update every frame. There are two options to address this:

1. Set the `Camera` `Camera/CameraType` to *‘Scriptable’*. When the `Camera` is *‘Scriptable’* the default scripts will not update the CFrame. This method is simplest and recommended in most cases

2. Replace the default [camera scripts]() with an alternative that doesn’t interfere with the developer’s desired implementation. This is only recommended when developers do not need any default `Camera` functionality




## How the Camera CFrame works

Like all `DataType/CFrame|CFrame` data, the `Camera` CFrame represents a position and an orientation.

The most intuitive way to position and orientate the `Camera` is by using the *new*`DataType/CFrame` constructor with the *pos* and *lookAt* parameters, for example:

```
local pos = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
local lookAt = Vector3.new(10, 0, 0)
local cameraCFrame = CFrame.new(pos, lookAt)
workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame = cameraCFrame
```

In the above example the `Camera` is positioned at *0, 10, 0* and oriented to be looking towards *10, 0, 0*.

## Animating the Camera CFrame

Although the `Camera` can be placed in the manner demonstrated above, you may want to animate the Camera to smoothly move from one `DataType/CFrame` to another. For this, there are a number of options:

1. Creating a `Tween` using `TweenService` that animates the CFrame property of the `Camera`. See the code sample below for an example of this
2. Setting the `Camera` CFrame every frame with `RunService/BindToRenderStep` and the *lerp*`DataType/CFrame` method */
	CFrame: CFrame;
	/** The default Roblox [camera scripts]() have several built in behaviors. Setting the CameraType of a player’s `Camera` will toggle between these behaviors. Note some CameraType’s require a valid `Camera/CameraSubject` to work correctly.

- Fixed: `Camera` is stationary
- Follow: `Camera` moves with the `Camera/CameraSubject` and rotates to keep the subject in the center of view
- Attach: `Camera` moves with the `Camera/CameraSubject` at a fixed offset and will rotate as the subject rotates
- Track: `Camera` moves with the `Camera/CameraSubject` but does not rotate automatically
- Watch: `Camera` is stationary but will rotate to keep the `Camera/CameraSubject` in the center of view
- Custom: Default
- Scriptable: No default behavior. Used by developers to script custom behavior



The above only applies when you use the default Roblox [camera scripts](). If you write your own camera scripts, you can choose to listen to CameraType and implement your own behaviors or ignore the property entirely.

## Manually controlling the Camera

In some cases you may wish to manually control the `Camera` (for example during a cut-scene). The best way to do this is by setting the CameraType to *‘Scriptable’*. The default [camera scripts]() will not move or update the `Camera` on its own if CameraType is set to *’Scriptable’*. This means you can freely modify the `Camera` using its properties and functions. For more information on positioning and orientating the `Camera` manually see the `Camera/CFrame|Camera.CFrame` page.

If you want complete control over the camera at all times, you may replace the default [camera scripts]() with your own. */

	/** Field of view, often shortened to FOV, is the extent of the observable game world that can be seen on screen at a given moment. The FieldOfView property is clamped between 1 and 120 degrees and defaults at 70. Very low or very high fields of view are not recommended as they can be disorientating to players.

The FieldOfView property sets how many degrees in the vertical direction (y-axis) the camera can view. Uniform scaling is enforced meaning the vertical and horizontal field of view are always related by the [aspect ratio]() of the screen. This means the FieldOfView property also determines the horizontal field of view.

See the images below for an example of how different FieldOfView settings can impact the extent of the perceptive game world. At a FOV of 70, a considerable portion of the game world is visible:

![A demonstration of the default FOV of 70](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b676631f9cd894d3d8ace1f/Fov70.png)

However when the FOV is reduced to 30, although the `Camera|Camera's` `Camera/CFrame` has not changed, a much smaller portion of the game world is rendered:

![A demonstration of a reduced FOV of 30](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b67662a74c0756340c86bfa/Fov30.png)

## Suggested uses for FieldOfView

Changing FOV can produce a variety of effects, such as:

- Reducing FOV to give the impression of magnification (for example when using binoculars)
- Increasing FOV when the player is ‘sprinting’ to give the impression of a lack of control */

	/** The `Camera` Focus is a `DataType/CFrame` that determines the area in 3D space the graphics engine will prioritize.

Certain graphical operations Roblox performs, such as updating lighting, can take a lot of time or computational effort to complete. Focus tells Roblox the area in 3D space to prioritize when performing such operations. For example dynamic lighting from objects such as `PointLight|PointLights` may not render at distances far from the Focus.

The default Roblox [camera scripts]() automatically set the Focus to follow the `Camera/CameraSubject` (usually a `Humanoid`). However, Focus will not be automatically updated in the following cases:

- When the `Camera/CameraType` is set to *‘Scriptable’*
- When the default [camera scripts]() are not being used



In these cases, you should update Focus every frame, using `RunService/BindToRenderStep` function at the *‘Camera’* `Enum/RenderPriority`.

local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")
local headCFrame = UserInputService:GetUserCFrame(Enum.UserCFrame.Head)

## Disabling HeadLocked

You are recommended not to disable HeadLocked for the following reasons:

- Players may experience motion sickness if an equivalent head tracking solution is not added
- The Roblox engine performs latency optimizations when HeadLocked is true



However in some circumstances you may wish to develop your own head tracking systems. For example, you may want custom camera transformations that restrict or augment the `DataType/CFrame` of the head.

The `DataType/Ray` originates from the `DataType/Vector3` equivalent of the 2D position in the world at the given depth (in studs) away from the `Camera`.

As this function does not account for the GUI inset, the viewport position given is not equivalent to the screen position used by GUI elements. If you are not using `ScreenGui/IgnoreGuiInset` and need an otherwise identical function that accounts for the GUI offset, use `Camera/ScreenPointToRay`.

```

local unitRay = camera:ViewportPointToRay(viewportPoint.X, viewportPoint.Y, 0)
```

As the `DataType/Ray` created is a unit ray it is only one stud long. To create a longer ray, you can do the following:

```
local camera = workspace.CurrentCamera
local length = 500
local unitRay = camera:ScreenPointToRay(100, 100)
local ray = Ray.new(unitRay.Origin, unitRay.Direction * length)

	/** The Offset of a mesh determines the distance from the `BasePart/Position` of a `BasePart` that the mesh will be displayed.

## How to use mesh offset

The Offset property changes the relative position the mesh will be rendered at. For example, an offset of 0, 5, 0 will cause the mesh to be displayed 5 studs above the position of the `BasePart`.

The position of the `BasePart` remains unchanged, meaning the physics collision box of the part will remain in the same location. This is demonstrated in the image below where the green outline (a `SelectionBox`) shows the extents of the `BasePart`.

![enter image description here](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltd3942dca6b981850/OffsetAnim.gif)

## Other uses for mesh offset

There are a number of interesting uses for the mesh offset property.

- Offset and `DataModelMesh/Scale` can be animated using `TweenService` relatively inexpensively as the engine does not need to make any physics/collision calculations as the `BasePart` is not moved.
- Changing the relationship between the mesh and its collision extents (determined by the `BasePart`) */
	Offset: Vector3;
	/** The Scale of a mesh determines the size of the mesh relative to its original dimensions.

## How to use mesh scale

The scale property works slightly differently depending on the type of mesh being used. Note the size of the `BasePart` remains unchanged, meaning the physics collision box of the part will remain the same.

- `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘FileMesh’ scale relative to the original dimensions of the mesh when it was uploaded to Roblox
- `BlockMesh` objects or `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘Brick’, ‘Wedge’ or ‘Sphere’ scale uniformly relative to the `BasePart/Size` of their parent
- `CylinderMesh` objects or `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘Cylinder’ scale relative to the `BasePart/Size` of their parent. Uniformly for the cylinders height axis and maintaining a 1:1 ratio for the length and width of the cylinder, using the lowest value.
- `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘Head’ currently scale in a non standard manner. Developers should not rely on this as their are plans to change this behavior
- `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘Torso’ scale in a non standard manner. Developers should not rely on this as their are plans to deprecate this mesh type.

The above behavior can be seen in the following demonstration images.

	/** Changes the hue of the mesh’s texture.

Note this property is only functional when a texture has been applied to the mesh. For this reason it only works with the `SpecialMesh` object as it includes the `SpecialMesh/TextureId` property.

## How to use VertexColor

See below for a visual example of the impact of VertexColor on a mesh’s texture.

![enter image description here](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt554914f560c80848/VertexColor_-_Copy.gif)

Note this property uses the `Vector3` rather than the `Color3` data type. Therefore developers will generally need to convert the `Color3` rgb components to the \`Vector3 xyz components. See below for a brief example.

```
local yellow = BrickColor.new("Bright yellow")
local yColor = yellow.Color
local yVector = Vector3.new(yColor.r,yColor.g,yColor.b)
workspace.Baseplate.Mesh.VertexColor = yVector
```

## Alternative to VertexColor

Although VertexColor can be used to make changes to the appearance of a Mesh’s texture much more flexibility is offered by uploading a new texture for the mesh. For more information on textures, see the page for `MeshPart`s. */

## How can I change the texture of a mesh?

Using the TextureId property, the texture of a mesh can be changed without having to reupload the mesh. To do this, a new image will need to be uploaded to Roblox with the desired texture. The original texture image file can be obtained by exporting the mesh using the ‘Export Selection’ option in Roblox Studio. The image file will be saved alongside the exported .obj file.

The new texture can then be re-uploaded to Roblox as a Decal and its content ID can be applied to the mesh using the TextureId property.

Registers a given `Instance` to the `Debris` service for removal after the specified delay. The first argument is the object being removed, and the second argument is the amount of time in seconds the `Debris` service will wait before removing the object. The delay argument is optional, if it is not specified, it defaults to 10 seconds. The delay argument is a number, so it accepts decimal points, such as ‘1.5’, or ‘0.25’.

**Why use Debris?**

Beyond creating a bit of a mess, objects that are no longer required can use up system memory and cause the game to run slower over time. For this reason it is always advised to run the `Instance/Destroy` function on objects you no longer need. However in many cases an object may have a specific period of utility after which it needs to be destroyed.

Take the example of projectile that has just been thrown. On first thought, it could be cleaned up using:

```
wait(3)
projectile:Destroy()
```

However there are a number of issues with this approach. Firstly, it requires yielding the code with a wait, which is not always desirable. Secondly, before the 3 seconds have elapsed the object may have already been destroyed (for example, if it reached `Workspace/FallenPartsDestroyHeight`). In this case, the code would error as it tries to destroy an item that has already been destroyed. One answer may be:

```
delay(3, function()
	if projectile and projectile.Parent then
		projectile:Destroy()
	end
end)
```

This solves the above issues, as it spawns a new thread to prevent the current one from yielding and checks to see if it can be destroyed. However at this point a simple command has already become quite complicated and an unnecessary thread is being created.

This is where Debris comes in, and the following code addresses all of the above issues.

```
Debris:AddItem(projectile, 3)
```

Debris does not yield the current thread, does not require a new thread and will not error if the object is already destroyed. For this reason it is the recommended method for cleaning up objects with a fixed lifetime. */

- Paste the URL into the Texture property in Roblox Studio. Roblox will automatically update the property to the correct Content ID. Note this only works in Roblox Studio and cannot be done from Scripts or whilst the game is running.
- Insert the Decal into the game, this is generally done through the Toolbox under ‘My Decals’. The Content ID can be found in the decal that is inserted. Note, `InsertService/LoadAsset` can also be used if developers wish to automate this method. */

The scalar size is relative to the scalar size of parent GUI elements, if any. For example, if the GUI’s scalar size is `UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0) and it is not the descendant of a GUI, then it will occupy half of the screen horizontally and vertically. However, if the GUI is the child of a GUI with a scalar size of`UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0), then the GUI’s scalar size will render to be half the scalar size of its parent both horizontally and vertically and will occupy a quarter of the screen in both dimensions.

The pixel portions of the `UDim2` value are the same regardless of the parent GUI’s size. The values represent the size of the object in pixels. For example, if Position is set to `{0, 100}, {0, 150}` the element will render with a width of 100 pixels and height of 150 pixels.

By default, when the user clicks the ‘x’ button in the top right corner of the `PluginGui` the `LayerCollector/Enabled|Enabled` property is set to *false*, closing the window. When a custom function is bound using BindToClose this behavior is overwritten, allowing you to check if the user really wants to close the window or give them an opportunity to save their work.

As the default closing behavior is overwritten by this function, you’ll need to configure the `PluginGui` to close manually by setting `LayerCollector/Enabled|PluginGui.Enabled` to *false*. For example, in the below snippet users are required to click a confirm button to close the GUI:

```
local closing = false
pluginGui:BindToClose(function()
    -- make sure we haven't already made a button
    if closing then
        return
    end
    closing = true

        pluginGui.Enabled = false
    
        -- remove confirm button
        confirmButton:Destroy()
    end)
end)

```
pluginGui:BindToClose()

	/** The DisplayDistanceType property controls how the humanoid display’s visibility behaves, based on the distance between the `Humanoid` and the player’s view.

When a Humanoid’s parent `BaseModel` has a part named *Head*, a visual display of the `Player`'s name and health is drawn 1.5 studs above the character’s head. This visual display is known as the **Humanoid Display**.

This property is set using the `Enum/HumanoidDisplayDistanceType` enum. There are three available values for this property, each with their own set of rules:

## None

When the DisplayDistanceType is set to **None**, the humanoid display will not be shown under any circumstances.

## Viewer

When the DisplayDistanceType is set to **Viewer**, the humanoid display’s visibility is locally controlled by the NameDisplayDistance and HealthDisplayDistance of each Player in the game. For instance, if a player has their display distance properties set to 50, and everyone else has their display distance properties set to 100, then that player will not be able to see the name and health of the humanoid at a distance greater than 50 studs, while everyone else can still see the name and health of the humanoid up to a distance of 100 studs.

![Viewer example](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blta3653f27a817f4f1/HumanoidViewerDistance.png)

In this example all of the NPC characters have their DisplayDistanceType set to Viewer. This means the distance the information will be displayed will be taken from the humanoid that is viewing them. In this case, the player character (who is in the foreground) has its HealthDisplayDistance set to 10 and NameDisplayDistance set to 20. The health bar is only visible on the closest NPC because it is within 10 studs, and the names of only the two closer NPCs are visible because they are within 20 studs.

---

## Subject

When the DisplayDistanceType is set to **Subject** the Humanoid’s name and healthbar will be displayed based on the viewed humanoid’s settings. This is useful when there are specific characters who you want to behave differently from other ones.

![Subject example](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt0484c3c0f5a98d64/HumanoidSubjectDistance.png)

In this example all of the NPC characters have their DisplayDistanceType set to Subject. This means the view distance of their information will depend on their individual HealthDisplayDistance and NameDisplayDistance properties.

- The NPC on the left has its HealthDisplayDistance and NameDisplayDistance set to 10. Since the NPC is 15 studs away, neither of the displays are visible.

- The NPC in the middle has its HealthDisplayDistance set to 10 and NameDisplayDistance set to 20. Since the NPC is 15 studs away, only the name is visible.

- The NPC on the right has its HealthDisplayDistance and NameDisplayDistance set to 20. Both name and health are visible, as the NPC is only 15 studs away. */

 It works with both regular parts and terrain voxels.

## Caveats

- When the Humanoid is not standing on a floor, the value of this property will be set to *Air*. - This occurs because Enum properties cannot have an empty value.
    - This can cause some confusion if a part has its material is set to Air, though in practice, parts are not supposed to use that material in the first place.

    

- The Humanoid’s character model must be able to collide with the floor, or else it will not be detected. - You cannot test if the Humanoid is swimming with this property. You should instead use the Humanoid’s GetState function. */

**Health** is a property that represents the current health of the Humanoid.

 Its value is constrained between 0, and the value of the Humanoid’s MaxHealth.

---

## Display Behavior

![The behavior of the HealthDIsplayType property](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt25d44cecfd3e9e09/HealthDisplayType.gif)

By default, the Humanoid displays a health bar under its name label when the Humanoid has taken damage. The display behavior of the health bar is dependent on the Humanoid’s HealthDisplayDistance and HealthDisplayType properties.

![The default health bar displayed in Roblox's top bar](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt081a90d0f606c745/CoreGuiHealth.png)

From the perspective of a Player, their character will never display the standard humanoid name & health label. Instead, it is displayed in the top right corner of the screen. The health bar will only be shown when the character’s health isn’t full.

The player’s character also has a default script inserted into it called **Health**, that regenerates their health by 1% continuously every second, until it is restored to full health.

---

## Damaging Humanoids

![ForceFields make you immune to explosions!](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltfa7dc6cd34b05fae/ExplosionImmunity.png)

When making Humanoids take damage, you are advised to utilize the Humanoid’s TakeDamage function. The TakeDamage function properly ignores damage when the Humanoid’s character model has a ForceField parented inside of it.

The ForceField object makes the character immune to explosions and is expected to make them immune to damage as well. You are allowed to just subtract from the Humanoid’s health, but it ultimately depends on whether or not you incorporate ForceFields into your game.

---

## Out of Health!

![The same Humanoid from the beginning, after being bloxxed by an explosion.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt9978f529dfcc80e6/Ooof.png)

When the value of the character’s health reaches 0, the Humanoid will automatically change into its *Dead* state, which makes the character break its joints and fall into pieces.

If there is a joint connecting the Head part to the character, the Head **must** remain connected to the character, such that `Head:GetRootPart() == Humanoid.RootPart`. You can think of the joint connection as the character’s neck. If you don’t have a neck between your head and torso, you are very dead. */

The Sit property is a boolean that indicates whether the `Humanoid` is currently sitting. `Humanoid|Humanoids` can be forced into a sitting state by setting this property’s value to true. If the `Humanoid` isn’t attached to a seat while in its sitting state, it will trip over with no collision in its legs. A `Humanoid` can escape from the sitting state by jumping.

## Notes

- The `Seat` or `VehicleSeat` the `Humanoid` is sitting on can be obtained using the `Humanoid/SeatPart` property
- It is possible to detect when a Humanoid sits by connecting to the `Humanoid/Seated` event. */

	/** ![A visualization of how WalkToPart changes the behavior of WalkToPoint](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltc76671f1665d7da0/WalkToPart.gif)

WalkToPart is a reference to a part that the Humanoid is trying to reach. This property is normally set when a part is passed as the 2nd argument of the Humanoid’s `Humanoid/MoveTo` function.

When WalkToPart is set and a humanoid is actively trying to reach the part, it will keep updating its Vector3 goal to be the position of the part, plus the `Humanoid/WalkToPoint` translated in object space relative to the rotation of the part.

This can be described in Lua as:

`goal = humanoid.WalkToPart.CFrame:pointToObjectSpace(humanoid.WalkToPoint)`

## Caveats

- Setting the value of WalkToPart isn’t sufficient enough to make a humanoid start following a part.
- The Humanoid is prompted to start attempting to reach a goal when the value of WalkToPoint is changed.
- This may be changed in the future.
- The *reach goal* state of a humanoid will timeout after 8 seconds if it doesn’t reach its goal.
- This is done so that NPCs won’t get stuck waiting for `Humanoid/MoveToFinished` to fire.
- If you don’t want this to happen, you should repeatedly call MoveTo so that the timeout will keep resetting. */

	/** ![A humanoid attempting to reach the goal specified using WalkToPoint and WalkToPart](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltc76671f1665d7da0/WalkToPart.gif)

WalkToPoint describes the 3D position in space that a humanoid is trying to reach, after having been prompted to do so by the

 Humanoid’s `Humanoid/MoveTo` function.

If a humanoid’s `Humanoid/WalkToPart` is set, the goal is set by transforming WalkToPoint relative to the parts position and rotation. If WalkToPart is not set, then the humanoid will try to reach the 3D position specified by WalkToPoint directly.

## Caveats

- The value of WalkToPoint must be changed to a different value in order for the humanoid to start walking towards it.
- If you want to make a humanoid walk to `0,0,0`, you should use the Humanoid’s MoveTo function.
- This may be changed in the future.
- The *reach goal* state of a humanoid will timeout after 8 seconds if it doesn’t reach its goal.
- This is done so that NPCs won’t get stuck waiting for `Humanoid/MoveToFinished` to fire.

For a measure of `Lighting`'s time formatted as a 24 hour string use `Lighting/CurrentTime`. Changing `Lighting/CurrentTime` or using `Lighting/SetMinutesAfterMidnight` will also change this property.

	local minutesNormalised = minutesAfterMidnight % (60 * 24)
	local hours = minutesNormalised / 60

	Lighting.ClockTime = hours

	wait()
end
```

Using `Lighting/TimeOfDay` requires the time to be normalized and a string formatted:

```
minutesAfterMidnight = 0
while true do
	minutesAfterMidnight = minutesAfterMidnight + 1

	local minutesNormalised = minutesAfterMidnight % (60 * 24)
	local seconds = minutesNormalised * 60
	local hours = string.format("%02.f", math.floor(seconds/3600))
	local mins = string.format("%02.f", math.floor(seconds/60 - (hours*60)))

	local timeString = hours..":"..mins..":"..secs

	Lighting.TimeOfDay = timeString

	wait()
end
```

Using `Lighting/SetMinutesAfterMidnight` requires no extra processing:

```
minutesAfterMidnight = 0
while true do
	minutesAfterMidnight = minutesAfterMidnight + 1

	Lighting:SetMinutesAfterMidnight(minutesAfterMidnight)

	wait()

	/** A `DataType/Color3` value giving the hue of `Lighting`'s fog.

## How does fog work?

Fog in Roblox is displayed in a plane perpendicular to the `Workspace/CurrentCamera`s direction. It fades between the `Lighting/FogStart` property where it is not visible, to the `Lighting/FogEnd` property where it is fully opaque. The effect of fog is it blends color with the FogColor.

At distances greater than `Lighting/FogEnd`, color will be determined entirely by the FogColor. However at distances between `Lighting/FogStart` and `Lighting/FogEnd` the degree to which the color is blended depends on the position.

Roblox’s fog uses linear interpolation between `Lighting/FogStart` and `Lighting/FogEnd`. This means if `Lighting/FogStart` is 10 and `Lighting/FogEnd` is 20, at a distance of 15 studs the fog will be at 50%. That means the color of a pixel at 15 studs will be 50% its normal color blended with 50% of the fog color.

```
local Lighting = game:GetService("Lighting")
-- fog will fade between 25 and 200 studs
Lighting.FogStart = 25
Lighting.FogEnd = 200
```

Note, fog does not obscure the skybox.

Roblox’s fog uses linear interpolation between `Lighting/FogStart` and FogEnd. This means if `Lighting/FogStart` is 10 and FogEnd is 20, at a distance of 15 studs the fog will be at 50%. That means the color of a pixel at 15 studs will be 50% its normal color blended with 50% of the fog color.

```
local Lighting = game:GetService("Lighting")
-- fog will fade between 25 and 200 studs
Lighting.FogStart = 25

The color of the fog can be adjusted using `Lighting/FogColor`.

	/** Toggles voxel-based dynamic lighting in the game

## What does GlobalShadows do?

When set to true, shadows are rendered in sheltered areas depending on the position of the sun and moon. The lighting hue applied to these areas is determined by the `Lighting/Ambient` property. The lighting hue in all other areas is determined by the `Lighting/OutdoorAmbient` property.

When disabled, shadows are not drawn and no distinction is made between indoor and outdoor areas. As a result, the `Lighting/Ambient` property determines the lighting hue and `Lighting/OutdoorAmbient` will do nothing.

Shadows are calculated using a voxel system, and each lighting voxel is 4x4x4 studs. This means objects need to be larger than 4x4x4 studs to display a realistic shadow. Shadows are also recalculated when `BasePart`s are moving.

Note, this property is unrelated to shadows from characters which are displayed regardless of what GlobalShadows is set to.

For more information about Roblox’s dynamic lighting, please see this [blog post]().

## Toggling GlobalShadows

Developers toggling the GlobalShadows setting will notice that disabling it makes the place considerably darker. This is because when GlobalShadows is disabled `Lighting/Ambient` is used to calculate the lighting hue in both indoor and ourdoor spaces. This darkness can be resolved by setting `Lighting/Ambient` to a higher value such as `Lighting/OutdoorAmbient`'s default value of 127, 127, 127.

In most cases developers are recommended to leave GlobalShadows enabled due to the superior visual appearance. See the image below for a comparison.

	GlobalShadows: boolean;
	/** The lighting hue applied to outdoor areas.

This property defaults to 127, 127, 127.

As long as the red, green and blue channels of `Lighting/Ambient` do not exceed the corresponding channels in this property, the hue of the lighting in outdoor areas will be determined by this property. The effective OutdoorAmbient value is clamped to be greater than or equal to `Lighting/Ambient` in all channels. This means, if a channel of `Lighting/Ambient` exceeds its corresponding OutdoorAmbient channel then the hue of `Lighting/Ambient` will begin to apply to outdoor areas. For a visual demonstration of this, please see the images below.

![enter image description here](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt6e6c67086eab8c57/Ambient.png)

Note, when `Lighting/GlobalShadows` is disabled there is no distinction between areas occluded from the sky and areas that are not. In this case OutdoorAmbient will be ignored and the hue from the `Lighting/Ambient` property will be applied everywhere.

For more properties that influence the color of lighting, please see `Lighting/ColorShift_Bottom` and `Lighting/ColorShift_Top`. */

For a numeric measure of `Lighting`'s time use `Lighting/ClockTime`. Changing `Lighting/ClockTime` or using `Lighting/SetMinutesAfterMidnight` will also change this property.

Using TimeOfDay requires the time to be normalized and a string formatted:

```
minutesAfterMidnight = 0
while true do
	minutesAfterMidnight = minutesAfterMidnight + 1

	local minutesNormalised = minutesAfterMidnight % (60 * 24)
	local seconds = minutesNormalised * 60

## How can I make a day / night script?

SetMinutesAfterMidnight allows a numerical value to be used, for example in a day/night cycle `Script`, without the need to convert to a string in the format required by `Lighting/TimeOfDay`. It also allows values greater than 24 hours to be given that correspond to times in the next day. See the code snippets below for an example.

Using `Lighting/TimeOfDay` requires the time to be normalized and a string formatted:

```lua

while true do
	minutesAfterMidnight = minutesAfterMidnight + 1

	local minutesNormalised = minutesAfterMidnight % (60 * 24)
	local seconds = minutesNormalised * 60

	local secs = string.format("%02.f", math.floor(seconds - hours*3600 - mins *60))
	local timeString = hours..":"..mins..":"..secs

	Lighting.TimeOfDay = timeString

	wait()
end
```

Using `Lighting/ClockTime` requires the time to be normalized:

	minutesAfterMidnight = minutesAfterMidnight + 1

	local minutesNormalised = minutesAfterMidnight % (60 * 24)
	local hours = minutesNormalised / 60

Using `Lighting/SetMinutesAfterMidnight` requires no extra processing:

```
local unitRayDirection = mouse.UnitRay.Direction
local mouseHitDirection = mouse.Hit.lookVector

Note, the roll of the `Workspace/CurrentCamera` is not used when calculating the orientation of the Hit `DataType/CFrame`.

## Outdated Physics Packet

This following debug message is printed if the PhysicsReceiver receives a mechanism update packet for a part that has been updated ahead of the packet’s submission time:

`Physics-in old packet`

This happens if the packet is received late, and a newer packet has already been processed.

---

## Unknown Part

This following debug message is printed if the PhysicsReceiver cannot find the part that is trying to be updated, because the provided Instance identifier was invalid:

`Physics-in of unidentified {GUID}`

 (Where `{GUID}` is the unknown `Instance/GetDebugId` identifier that is supposed to be targeting the part)

This typically happens if a part is removed before the physics update packet is received.

---

## Invalid Part

This following debug message is printed if the PhysicsReceiver receives a request to update the physics of a part that is not a descendant of the Workspace:

`Physics-in of part not in workspace {GUID}`

 (Where `{GUID}` is the `Instance/GetDebugId` identifier of the target part)

This usually happens if the part was just moved out of the Workspace, and was previously being simulated.

While fully transparent parts are not rendered at all, partially transparent objects have some significant rendering costs. Having many translucent parts may slow down the game’s performance.

If this property is set to nil, or the CurrentCamera is otherwise destroyed, a new `Camera` will be created and assigned.

When looking for a client’s `Camera` object, developers should use this property rather than looking for a child of `Workspace` named ‘Camera’.

## What can be done with CurrentCamera

Accessing a client’s current `Camera` object brings a range of uses.

- Manipulating the viewport using the `Camera` functions
- Bbjects parented to the `Camera` will not replicate to the server, regardless of what `Workspace/FilteringEnabled` is set to. Prior to `Workspace/FilteringEnabled`, this was the main way to render `BasePart`s on one client only.

workspace.CurrentCamera.FieldOfView = 100
``` */

## What happens to falling parts?

For performance reasons, Roblox automatically destroys (using `Instance/Destroy`) parts that fall below this value. This is to prevent parts that have fallen off the map from continuing to fall forever.

This property can be read by scripts, but can only be set by plugins, the command bar or the properties window in Roblox Studio.

## Notes

- Developers should also use the `Debris` service to clean up parts that are no longer needed, but have not fallen off the map
- This property is clamped between -50,000 and 50,000. This is because `BasePart`s do not simulate or render properly at a great distance from the origin due to floating point inaccuracies */

	/** Warning! Experimental Mode has been discontinued, meaning this property will no longer take effect. 

Determines whether changes made from the client will replicate to the server or not. When this property is disabled, the game is in ‘Experimental Mode’.

This property is not replicated, meaning it cannot be changed once the game has started. For this reason, developers should only set this property in Roblox Studio.

## What does FilteringEnabled do?

When FilteringEnabled is disabled, the place is in ‘Experimental Mode’. In ‘Experimental Mode’, changes made to the game on the client replicate back to the server. For some, this makes games simpler to make, but means exploiters can change nearly anything in the game (such as deleting the baseplate).

When FilteringEnabled is enabled, everything continues to replicate from the server to the client (with a few exceptions such as `ServerStorage` and `ServerScriptStorage`). However, actions made by the client will no longer freely replicate to the server. Instead, `RemoteEvent`s and `RemoteFunction`s need to be used by the client to ‘request’ the server preforms certain actions on its behalf.

## What are the exceptions to FilteringEnabled?

Whilst FilteringEnabled prevents almost everything from replicating from the client to the server, there are some exceptions.

- Some properties on the local `Humanoid`
- `Sound` playback, when `SoundService/RespectFilteringEnabled` is set to false
- `ClickDetector` input events
- `AnimationTrack` playback
- Physics simulated on `BasePart`s which the client has `Articles/Network Ownership — Making physics smoother!|network ownership` of



## Is FilteringEnabled more secure?

Enabling FilteringEnabled is the best way of restricting exploiters from ruining your games. When it is enabled, with a few exceptions, changes made by clients will not replicate to the server (and therefore will not replicate to other clients). This means, if your game is properly designed, exploiters will find it much harder to operate in your game.

Enabling FilteringEnabled however, has implications on a game’s design that developers must consider. Before using it, it is highly recommended developers familiarize themselves on the following topics:

- `Articles/Experimental Mode|Experimental Mode` A brief introduction to the client-server model
- `Articles/Building Games with Experimental Mode Off|Building games with Experimental Mode off` How to approach building a game with FilteringEnabled
- [Converting Experimental Mode games](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Converting-From-Experimental-Mode) Converting a g */

	/** The StreamingEnabled property determines whether network streaming is enabled for the place.

This property is not scriptable, and therefore cannot be changed once the game has started. For this reason, it is advised it is set in Roblox Studio.

Since it is replicated, both client and server can access the property to determine, but not set, whether network streaming is enabled. As a result, both the code snippets below will print the same value when executed from a `LocalScript` and `Script` in the same game.

```lua
-- LocalScript
local isStreamingEnabled = game.Workspace.StreamingEnabled
print(isStreamingEnabled)
```

```lua
-- Script
local isStreamingEnabled = game.Workspace.StreamingEnabled
print(isStreamingEnabled)
```

### What is network streaming?

Streaming is an opt-in feature builders can enable for their places. It’ll allow places to have more `BasePart|BaseParts`, faster join times, and allow more games to run on less powerful hardware. It does this by allowing games to be played whilst objects are still being downloaded, and removing objects that are no longer needed.

The downside of network streaming is it means the client can no longer rely on specific objects being available. Developers should not enable StreamingEnabled unless they understand its implications and have put processes in place to manage them. For example, `LocalScript|LocalScripts` may have to use `Instance/WaitForChild` in order to access parts of the game.

	/** Returns an array of `BasePart`s in the given `DataType/Region3`.

This function takes an optional maxParts parameter (default 20) which limits the number of `BasePart`s that can be returned. Once this number has been reached, the search for `BasePart`s will stop. This means some `BasePart`s may not be returned even if they are within the `DataType/Region3`

The optional ignoreDescendentsInstance parameter can be used to specify a specific instance for whom itself and all of its descendants should be ignored by this function. This can be useful when, for example, looking to see if any `BasePart`s are inside a `BasePart` other than the `BasePart` itself.

```
local min = part.Position - (0.5 * part.Size)
local max = part.Position + (0.5 * part.Size)
local region = Region3.new(min, max)
local parts = workspace:FindPartsInRegion3(region, part) --  ignore part
```

Variants of this function exist with ignore-list and white-list functionality, `Workspace/FindPartsInRegion3WithIgnoreList` and `Workspace/FindPartsInRegion3WithWhiteList`.

If no `BasePart`s are found, an empty array will be returned.

## How do Region3 checks work?

Checking if a part overlaps a `DataType/Region3` is not a simple process. It actually is time consuming and complicated. Instead it checks if parts are roughly in the same area. When this function is called, it figures out which voxels contain the `DataType/Region3`. It then figures out which parts might be in those voxels. It does this by comparing the axis-aligned bounding box (sometimes called the AABB) of the part with the voxels. The axis-aligned bounding box can be seen in Roblox Studio when a part is selected.

This means that the area that is inspected by the function may be larger than the `DataType/Region3`. For this reason it is recommended to make sure that the `DataType/Region3` is on the voxel grid. The best way to do this is by setting the coordinates of the `DataType/Region3` to multiples of 4 (since voxels are 4 x 4 x 4 studs).

This method is a fairly quick and easy way to see if parts are in a general area. If a game needs to know if parts are exactly in an area, then `BasePart/GetTouchingParts` should be used. There is a higher cost to using `BasePart/GetTouchingParts` since a part is needed in the `Workspace` and the function takes more time to run. */

## Sleeping vs Awake Parts

In order to ensure good performance, Roblox sets `BaseParts` in which physics are not being applied to a ‘sleeping’ state. `BasePart`s with `BasePart/Anchored` set to true, for example, will always be sleeping as physics does not apply to them. When a force is applied to an non anchored `BasePart`, an ‘awake’ state will be applied. Whilst a `BasePart` is awake the Roblox physics engine will perform continuous calculations to ensure physical forces interact correctly with the part. Once the `BasePart` is no longer subject to physical forces, it will revert to a ‘sleeping’ state. */

This function can be used to determine whether, and to what degree, physics throttling is occurring.

## What is physics throttling?

Physics throttling occurs when the physics engine detects it cannot keep up with the game in realtime. When physics is being throttled, it will update less frequently causing `BasePart`s to appear to move slower.

Without throttling, the physics simulation would fall further behind out of sync with the game. This can lead to lower frame rates and other undesirable behavior.

Objects associated with `Humanoid`s are exempt from physics throttling.

See also `Workspace/SetPhysicsThrottleEnabled`.

## Demonstrating physics throttling

Developers should always avoid creating places that overload the physics engine, as it leads to sub-par experience for players. Those wishing to simulate physics throttling for research purposes however, need only create a lot of `Part`s very quickly.

```
local i = 0
while true do
	i = i + 1
	if i % 5 == 0 then
		wait()
	end

	/** Returns the number of frames per second that physics is currently being simulated at.

## Using GetRealPhysicsFPS to combat exploiters

A common use of this function is to detect if exploiters are increasing their local physics frame rate to move faster. This is generally done by comparing the result returned by a client’s GetRealPhysicsFPS to a maximum that will not be breached in normal circumstances (usually 65 or 70). If this limit is breached, developers can use the `Player/Kick` function to remove that `Player` from the game. It is important to remember that, although this practice may be effective sometimes, client-side anti-exploiter measures are never 100% reliable. */

It is defined using a `DataType/Vector3` to determine the acceleration on the global X/Y/Z axes. It is measured in studs per second squared. When changed, this property affects all particles emit by the emitter, both current and future particles.

Pictured below are two default ParticleEmitters. The foreground (right) emitter has an Acceleration on the positive-X axis, causing the path of the particles to bend in that direction.

![An image of two default ParticleEmitters, wherein the foreground emitter has a +X Acceleration](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltaeb3393ea3390868/ParticleEmitter_Acceleration.png)

Acceleration will slow particles down if the vector points in the opposite `ParticleEmitter/EmissionDirection` in which particles are emitted. Otherwise, it will speed them up. You can use `ParticleEmitter/Drag` to slow particles down no matter what direction they travel.

Acceleration is most often used to apply a gravity effect to particles (try a value of (0, -3, 0) for this). You can also use small values on the X/Z axes to make it look like particles are being blown away by wind. If you emit a bubble particle downwards, you could use an acceleration of (0, 5, 0) to cause the bubbles to decelerate and then float back upwards. */

Below, two default `ParticleEmitter` are pictured, except the right emitter uses a Color from yellow to cyan.

![Two default ParticleEmitters, except the right has a Color from Yellow to Cyan](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt07a957ff7394b365/ParticleEmitter_Color.png)

Note that the default `ParticleEmitter/Lifetime` is 5 to 10 seconds, so some particles next to each other have small variations in color due to the variations in individual particle lifetime.

A particle’s present color is determined by linearly interpolating on this ColorSequence using the particle’s age and the particle’s total lifetime. For example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second lifetime, the color will be whatever is 50% of the way through the `DataType/ColorSequence`.

Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the system. This is because the color of a particle is determined using its present lifetime and this ColorSequence (the ColorSequence when the particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis). */

Drag is applied by scaling the expected velocity (from `ParticleEmitter/Speed` and any velocity inherited from the parent from `ParticleEmitter/VelocityInheritance`) by the following formula: `2 ^ (elapsedTime * -drag)`, where `elapsedTime` is the time since the particle was emit. Consequently, setting Drag to a negative value will cause particles’ velocities to grow exponentially.

A lifetime of 0 will prevent particles from being emit in the first place.

it is important to pick a sensible Lifetime and `ParticleEmitter/Rate` so that you don’t have too many particles being rendered at once. Long lifetimes and high emission rates are a quick way to cause performance issues. If you need many particles, pick a balance of lifetime and rate. To instantly remove any presently emit particles (perhaps ones with absurdly long lifetimes), you can call `ParticleEmitter/Clear`. */

When changed, this property instantly affects all particles owned by the emitter, both current and future particles.

Pictured below are two default ParticleEmitters. The right one has its LightEmission set to 1, so the particles appear brighter due to the additive blending when they overlap.

it is important to pick a sensible `ParticleEmitter/Lifetime` and Rate so that you don’t have too many particles being rendered at once. Long lifetimes and high emission rates are a quick way to cause performance issues. If you need many particles, pick a balance of lifetime and rate. To instantly remove any presently emit particles (perhaps ones with absurdly long lifetimes), you can call `ParticleEmitter/Clear`. */

A random angular speed is chosen upon emission, so changing this property will not affect already emit particles. This property, along with `ParticleEmitter/Rotation` affect the angle of the rendered particle image. This property is a `DataType/NumberRange` measured in degrees per second.

Below is an animation of two default `ParticleEmitter`s. The right has a nonzero RotSpeed, so its particles rotate as they move through the world.

![Two default ParticleEmitters; the right emitter has a RotSpeed applied](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltfe2427c2a9f0f3ad/ParticleEmitter_RotSpeed.gif)

Using a spiral as a `ParticleEmitter/Texture` like the one below, you can create some quite interesting particle effects:

![A swirl texture](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltc50865c165e13d07/ParticleEmitter_RotSpeed2_swirl.gif)![A portal effect using RotSpeed and a Swirl texture]()

Particles with very high angular speeds can appear to rotate slower or not at all - this is because the angle of rotation is synchronized with the software render speed. In other words, if the particle is rotating at exactly 360 degrees every frame, there will be no apparent change in rotation. */
	RotSpeed: NumberRange;
	/** The Rotation property determines the angle at which new particles are emit. It is a `DataType/NumberRange` measured in degrees. Positive values are in the clockwise direction. This property is often set to [0, 360] to provide a completely random rotation to new particles. `ParticleEmitter/RotSpeed` also influences the rotation of a particle over its lifetime. Finally, this property is useful for correcting any `ParticleEmitter/Texture`s that aren’t at the desired orientation.

Pictured below are two default ParticleEmitters, except that the right has a Rotation of 22.5. Note how the particles on the left are straight up, and the right are tilted slightly.

![Two default ParticleEmitters with varying Rotations](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltb0b7b9f3f01688b2/ParticleEmitter_Rotation.png)

	/** The Size property determines the world size in studs of all active particles over their individual lifetimes. This property represents the dimensions of the square `ParticleEmitter/Texture` for each particle. It is a `DataType/NumberSequence` that works similar to `ParticleEmitter/Transparency` and `ParticleEmitter/Color`.

Below is an animation of two default `ParticleEmitter` where the right one has a Size of 0 to 2. Note how the particles grow over their lifetime.

![Animation of two default ParticleEmitters; the right one has a Size of 0 to 2](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt908c9ca9b5bddace/ParticleEmitter_Size.gif)

A particle’s present size is determined by linearly interpolating on this NumberSequence using the particle’s age and the particle’s total lifetime. For example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second lifetime, the size will be whatever is 50% of the way through the `DataType/NumberSequence`. For any `DataType/NumberSequenceKeypoint` with a nonzero envelop value, a random value in the envelop range is chosen for each keypoint for each particle when it spawns.

Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the system. This is because the size of a particle is determined using its present lifetime and this NumberSequence (the Size at the time the particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis).

## Design Note

When designing particle effects, size is probably the most important of all properties. Too large or too subtle can ruin a particle effect! The first thing you should do is decide how you want particles to enter and exit view - fade in/out, or grow/shrink from size 0? The choice is yours - start with a size NumberSequence from 0 to 3 or the reverse and go from there. */
	Size: NumberSequence;
	/** The Speed property determines the random range of velocities that newly emit particles may have. It is measured in studs per second using a `DataType/NumberRange`. The velocity is chosen upon emission, and is applied in the `ParticleEmitter/EmissionDirection`. Negative speed values will cause particles to travel in reverse.

Below is an animation of two default `ParticleEmitter`s; the left has the default Speed of 5. The right one has the Speed range set to [20, 20], so its particles emit at a constant speed of 20.

![Two default ParticleEmitters, the right has a speed of 20.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blte13fc189c250bd2b/ParticleEmitter_Speed.gif)

`ParticleEmitter/VelocityInheritance`, `ParticleEmitter/Acceleration` and `ParticleEmitter/Drag` will affect a particle’s speed over its lifetime. Changing Speed will not affect already existing particles - they will retain whatever speed they have already. */
	Speed: NumberRange;
	/** The SpreadAngle property determines the random angles that a particle may be emit. On emission, a random angle is selected uniformly using the range defined by SpreadAngle. For example, if the `ParticleEmitter/EmissionDirection` is Top (+Y), then this `DataType/Vector2` describes the size of the random angle spread on the X/Z axes, in degrees. The particle is given a velocity based on the `ParticleEmitter/Speed` in the chosen direction.

Below is an animation of two default ParticleEmitters. The foreground (closer) emitter has one of its SpreadAngle axes set to 90 degrees, so particles are emit randomly in an arc.

![Two default ParticleEmitters. The foreground (closer) emitter has one axis of SpreadAngle set to 90 degrees](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt05b793010052f4b7/ParticleEmitter_SpreadAngle.gif)

	/** The Transparency property determines the transparency in studs of all active particles over their individual lifetimes. It works similar to `ParticleEmitter/Size` in how it affects particles over time. In terms of rendering, it works like the `BasePart/Transparency` of a part.

Pictured below are two default `ParticleEmitter`s. The right emitter has a Transparency set to a `DataType/NumberSequence` that interpolates from 0 to 1.

![Two default ParticleEmitters; the right emitter Transparency fades over the lifetime of the particles](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt7d318803556982ca/ParticleEmitter_Transparency.png)

The behavior of this property varies depending on whether Roblox's physics engine is using the *PGS Physics Solver*, or the *Spring Physics Solver*.

### Spring Physics Solver



When \`Workspace/PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled\` is set to false, the contact points are color coded as listed below.

, and the length of the arrow will always be 1 stud. 

There are no special conditions tracked, because the PGS solver does not keep specific lookup tables for the states listed in the Spring Solver.

## Notes

LocalScripts that are cloned from `StarterGui` or `StarterPack` into a player’s `Backpack` or `PlayerGui` are often run before the old Character model is deleted.

local character = player.Character
if not character or not character.Parent then
    character = player.CharacterAdded:wait()

But from the server it’s fine to do this:

When mouse lock is enabled, the player’s cursor is locked to the center of the screen.

## GetJoinData and TeleportData

If the teleport the `Player` arrived in the current place due to was initiated on a server (as opposed to a client) the `Player|Player’s` *teleportData* is included in the dictionary returned by this function.

This function can only be used to fetch *teleportData* on the server, to retrieve it on the client use `TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData`.

In contrast to `TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData`, this function provides a number of security checks to the *teleportData*:

- It is guaranteed to have been sent by a Roblox server in the last 48 hours
- It is guaranteed to have been sent with this `Player`
- The SourcePlaceId returned is guaranteed to be the place the data was sent from. This means you can verify the TeleportData came from an approved place



However, as this data is transmitted by the client, it not 100% secure. Although the user cannot modify this data it is possible for them to view it or insert data from a previous teleport.

Despite this, it is still appropriate for the secure transmission of [immutable data]() (data that can not be changed). For example, if the user has completed a level that cannot be uncompleted. Such data can be securely transmitted using this function avoiding the need to use up and wait for `GlobalDataStore|DataStore` requests when teleporting.

You should not use this function for data that can be changed. For example, the amount of in-game currency the user currently has. This is because GetJoinData cannot guarantee a malicious user is not transmitting data from a previous session. For data like this, you should rely on `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores`.

As with all cases, you should implement proper server validation to ensure your game is secure. For more information see this article on `Articles/Game Security`. */

## Chat Commands

Using this event and some string manipulation functions like `string.sub` and `string.lower`, it is possible to create chat commands, even with arguments like player names. Usually, commands are prefixed such as `/heal PlayerName`. To check for a prefix in a string, use `string.sub` on the message to check a substring of the message: `string.sub(message, 1, 6) == "/heal "` (note the inclusion of the space) . Then, extract the rest of the command using `string.sub` again: `string.sub(message, 7)` will be equal to the player name. Check if that player exists, and if so, perform the command’s action (in this example, healing them). Check the code samples for examples of chat commands.

## Filtering

The message text fired with this event is **unfiltered**. If you are displaying player input like chat to other players in any form, it must be filtered using `Chat/FilterStringAsync`. Keep this in mind when creating your own chat systems; if your game does not properly filter chat it may have moderation action taken against it. */

As it is linked to the client’s rendering process, BindToRenderStep can only be called on the client.

## Name

The `name` parameter is a label for the binding, and can be used with `RunService/UnbindFromRenderStep` if the binding is no longer needed.

```
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

local function functionToBind() end

-- Bind the function above to the binding named "tempBinding"
RunService:BindToRenderStep("tempBinding", 1, functionToBind)
-- Unbind the function bound to "tempBinding"
RunService:UnbindFromRenderStep("tempBinding")
```

## Priority

The `priority` of the binding is an integer, and determines when during the render step to call the custom function. The lower this number, the sooner the custom function will be called. If two bindings have the same priority the Roblox engine will randomly pick one to run first. The default Roblox control scripts run with these specific priorities:

- Player Input: 100
- Camera Controls: 200

 For convenience, the `Enum/RenderPriority` enum can be used to determine the integer value to set a binding. For example, to make a binding right before the default camera update, simply subtract 1 from the camera priority level.



> **Note:** When using Enum.RenderPriority, remember to use ***InlineCode.Value*** at the end of the desired enum. BindToRenderStep will not work if just the enum on its own is used.

```
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

local function beforeCamera(delta)
	-- Code in here will run before the default Roblox camera script
end

RunService:BindToRenderStep("Before camera", Enum.RenderPriority.Camera.Value - 1, beforeCamera)
```

## Custom Function and Delta Time

The last argument of BindToRenderStep is the `custom function` to call. This function will be passed one parameter called deltaTime. ***DeltaTime*** shows how much time passed between the beginning of the previous render step and the beginning of the current render step.

> **Note:** All rendering updates will wait until the code in the render step finishes. Make sure that any code called by BindToRenderStep runs quickly and efficiently. If code in BindToRenderStep takes too long, then the game visuals will be choppy. */

## Private servers

Private servers refer to the following:

- `Articles/Creating a VIP Server on Roblox|VIP servers`, private servers that can be purchased by players from the games page
- Reserved servers, private servers created by the developer using `TeleportService/ReserveServer`



## PrivateServerId vs JobId

The PrivateServerId of a server is different to the `DataModel/JobId`. The `DataModel/JobId|JobId` is the unique identifier of the current server instance.

Private servers (VIP or reserved servers) can have multiple server instances associated with them over time. This is because, although only one server instance can be running at once for a private server, new server instances can open and close as players join and leave the game. For example, no server instance is running when nobody is playing in the server. The PrivateServerId will be consistent across all of these server instances, the `DataModel/JobId` will be unique for each once.

- **LinearSquare:** Volume attenuates between `Sound/EmitterSize` and `Sound/MaxDistance` with a linear squared relationship



**Inverse vs Linear Distance Attenuation**

By default sounds are set to use inverse distance attenuation (Enum.RollOffMode.Inverse) which mirrors how sounds attenuate in the real world. Under inverse distance attenuation, sounds will begin to attenuate once the distance between the listener and the Sound’s parent exceeds `Sound/EmitterSize`. The rate of attenuation depends on the emitter size, as sounds with larger EmitterSize’s will attenuate at a slower rate. Inverse rate of inverse distance attenuation is further influenced by `SoundService/RolloffScale`.

Note, `Sound/MaxDistance` will not effect attenuation under the inverse model but will cause the sound to cut off completely once this distance is reached. This can be particularly abrupt when using low values for max distance.

Linear distance attenuation works differently. Under linear distance attenuation the sound will attenuate between `Sound/EmitterSize` and `Sound/MaxDistance`, falling silent once MaxDistance is reached. `Sound/EmitterSize` still denotes the point at which the sound will begin attenuating. However, the audible volume at any point now depends on the point the listener is at between EmitterSize and MaxDistance. This means, in contrast to the inverse distance attenuation model, the audible volume of the sound will approach silence at MaxDistance point. This is less realistic, but may be more desirable in some cases. */

Teleport settings are preserved across teleportations within the same game. This means data can be saved using `TeleportService/SetTeleportSetting` in one place and retrieved using GetTeleportSetting in another place the user has been teleported to.

For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting. This could then be retrieved in the destination place after the teleportation:

```
local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")

local isCrouching =  TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting("isCrouching")
```

If no teleport setting exists under the given key, this function will return *nil*.

## Differences from GlobalDataStores

Although they share some similarities, there are some key differences between teleport settings and datastores:

- `GlobalDataStore/SetAsync` stores the data on Roblox servers whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally
- Data stored in a `GlobalDataStore` is preserved after the user leaves the game universe whereas teleport settings are not
- `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` can only be accessed on the server, whereas teleport settings can only be accessed on the client
- `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` have usage limits, whereas teleport settings do not



In general teleport settings should be used to preserve client side information within a single play session across different places in a game. `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` should be used to save important player data that needs to be accessed across player sessions.

## Teleport settings and security

As teleport settings are stored locally, it is possible they can be manipulated by malicious users. This risk can be mitigated by employing server side validation, for more information on this please see the article on `Articles/Game Security`. */
	GetTeleportSetting(setting: string): unknown;

Note, the `ScreenGui|teleport GUI` will not be used if the destination place is in a different game. It will also not persist across multiple teleports and will need to be set prior to each one.

This function should only be used on the client. If the teleportation function is called from the server (as is the case with `TeleportService/TeleportPartyAsync`) then this function should be called on the client prior to this. One way of doing this is listening to a `RemoteEvent` that fires several seconds before teleportation.

```
-- Client

local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer
local teleportGui = Instance.new("ScreenGui") -- for demonstration purposes

-- this RemoteEvent needs to be created on the server and fired before teleporting
local teleportEvent = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("TeleportPrepare")

-- set the teleport gui so we are ready
TeleportService:SetTeleportGui(teleportGui)

teleportEvent.OnClientEvent:Connect(function()
    -- show the gui prior to the teleport
    local playerGui = localPlayer:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")
    teleportGui.Parent = playerGui
end)
```

## Loading screen

During a teleport, whilst the destination place is loading, the *customLoadingScreen* is parented to the `CoreGui`. Once the place has loaded the `ScreenGui|loading screen` is `Instance/Parent|parented` to *nil*.

This `ScreenGui` can be fetched at the destination place using `TeleportService/GetArrivingTeleportGui`, allowing you to parent it to the `PlayerGui` and perform your own transitions.

You are advised to also `Instance/Parent|parent` the `ScreenGui` to the `PlayerGui` in the start place whilst the teleport is initiating. */
	SetTeleportGui(gui: Instance): void;
	/** This function stores a value under a given key that persists across all teleportations in the same game.

This method is intended for use on the client only and should not be used on the server.

The stored value can later be retrieved using `TeleportService/GetTeleportSetting`. This will work in the current place and any subsequent places the `Players/LocalPlayer` teleports to, provided they are in the same game.

For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting:

```
local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")

local isCrouching = false
TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting("isCrouching", isCrouching)
```

The stored value can take one of the following forms:

- A table without mixed keys (all strings or all integers)
- A string
- A number
- A bool



If data is already stored under the given key, the previous value will be overwritten by the new value.

## Differences from GlobalDataStores

Although they share some similarities, there are some key differences between teleport settings and datastores:

- `GlobalDataStore/SetAsync` stores the data on Roblox servers whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally
- Data stored in a `GlobalDataStore` is preserved after the user leaves the game universe whereas teleport settings are not

	SetTeleportSetting(setting: string, value?: any): void;
	/** This function teleports a `Player` to the place instance associated with the given *placeId* and *instanceId*. It can only be used to teleport to places in the same game.

The *placeId* is the `DataModel/PlaceId` of the server and the *instanceId* is the `DataModel/JobId|JobId`.

This function can not be used to teleport `Player|Players` to servers created using `TeleportService/ReserveServer` (reserved servers). For this, see `TeleportService/TeleportToPrivateServer`.

## Spawn name

An optional *spawnName* parameter can be provided, which will cause the `Player` to initially spawn at the `SpawnLocation` of that name in the destination place. The `SpawnLocation` must be valid for the `Player` to spawn on. For example, it must be `SpawnLocation/Neutral|neutral` or set to the same `SpawnLocation/TeamColor|TeamColor` as the `Team` the `Player` will be assigned to upon joining the game.

## Teleport data

A *teleportData* parameter can be specified. This is data the client will transmit to the destination place and can be retrieved using `TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData`.

The *teleportData* can take any of the following forms:

- A table without mixed keys (all keys are strings or integers)
- A string
- A number
- A bool



As the *teleportData* is transmitted by the client it is not secure. For this reason it should only be used for local settings and not sensitive items (such as the users’ score or in-game currency).

If you need teleport data to persist across multiple teleports, you can use `TeleportService/SetTeleportSetting` and `TeleportService/GetTeleportSetting`.

## Loading screen

A *customLoadingScreen* argument can be specified. This is a `ScreenGui` that is copied (without scripts) into the `CoreGui` of the destination place.

Note, `TeleportService/SetTeleportGui` is the preferred alternative to the *customLoadingScreen* argument as it can be called prior to the teleport.

The loading `ScreenGui` can be obtained in the destination place using `TeleportService/GetArrivingTeleportGui`, where developers can parent it to the `PlayerGui`.

## Teleport failure

In some circumstances a teleport may fail. This can be due to the developer configuring the teleport incorrectly or issues with Roblox’s servers.

- If a teleportation request is rejected the `TeleportService/TeleportInitFailed` event will fire the error message and a `Enum/TeleportResult` enumerator describing the issue
- Teleports can fail ‘in transit’, after the user has left the server, due to issues with Roblox’s servers. In this case the user will be shown an error message and be required to rejoin the game



For more information on how to teleport players, see the `Articles/Teleporting Between Places` tutorial. */

The `Player` will still spawn at the correct `SpawnLocation` even the teleport is to a place in a different universe. The spawn will also be correct if `Players/CharacterAutoLoads` is false in the destination place and the `Player/Character|Character` is loaded manually using `Player/LoadCharacter|LoadCharacter`.

The teleportation will only affect the `SpawnLocation` used initially. If the `Player` respawns again subsequently it will not necessarily be at this `SpawnLocation`.

This event should be connected immediately in a `LocalScript` parented to `ReplicatedFirst`. Otherwise, when the connection is made the event may have already fired.

## Loading screen

During a teleport, whilst the destination place is loading, the *customLoadingScreen* is parented to the `CoreGui`. Once the place has loaded the `ScreenGui|loading screen` is `Instance/Parent|parented` to *nil*.

If you wish to preserve the *customLoadingScreen* and perform your own transitions, you will need to parent it to the `Players/LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer’s` `PlayerGui`. For example, using the following code inside a `LocalScript` in `ReplicatedFirst`:

```
local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ReplicatedFirst = game:GetService("ReplicatedFirst")

TeleportService.LocalPlayerArrivedFromTeleport:Connect(function(customLoadingScreen, teleportData)

## Usage

This method should be called once each time a user submits a message. Do not cache the results of this function and re-use them for separate messages. If a user submits the same text multiple times this method must be called again each time the message is sent. If the results are cached and reused spam detection and many forms of context-aware filtering will be broken and potentially put user safety at risk. Games that improperly use cached results may face moderation.

However, it is encouraged to keep these result objects to display the same message to users who join the server later. For example: this can be used to safely and efficiently implement a server chat log that always uses the least restrictive filtering for users who join later, or for efficiently displaying text like a pet name to a user who joins the game after the pet was first spawned and name filtered.

The optional `Enum/TextFilterContext` parameter will not impact the filtered result of the query. This value will be used to improve Roblox’s text filtering.

Private text is anything that is seen only by specific players, rather than every player. For example, if the chat is seen by a single player, or by a selected group of players, then the chat is considered private. Chat for teams or chat that is potentially visible to a wider group, such as the server, is considered public. If you are unsure what your text qualifies as, leave the optional field blank.

## Notes

- This method always yields to make a text filtering service call
- This method may throw if there is a service error that can not be resolved. If this function throws an error please do not retry the request; this method implements it’s own retry logic internally. If this method fails do not display the text to any user.
- This method currently throws if *fromUserId* is not online on the current server. We plan to support users who are offline or on a different server in the future. */

The lifetime of a trail is also used by that effect’s `Trail/Color` and `Trail/Transparency` properties to determine how each segment is drawn.

\##Stretch

 Stretch is the default TextureMode for Trails. In this mode the texture will be tiled a number of times equal to the number defined by TextureLength.

For example, if the trail’s attachments are 2 stud’s apart, and the value of this property is 0.5, the trail’s width will be 1 stud and the trail will be centered in between the two attachments.

1. *Default*: The mouse moves freely around the user’s screen.
2. *LockCenter*: The mouse is locked, and cannot move from, the center of the user’s screen.
3. *LockCurrentPosition*: The mouse is locked, and cannot move from, it’s current position on the user’s screen at the time of locking.



The value of this property does not affect the sensitivity of events tracking mouse movement. For example, `UserInputService/GetMouseDelta|GetMouseDelta` returns the same `DataType/Vector2|Vector2` screen position in pixels regardless of whether the mouse is locked or able to move freely around the user’s screen. As a result, default scripts like those controlling the camera are not impacted by this property.

This property is overridden if a `GuiButton` with `GuiButton/Modal|Modal` enabled is `GuiButton/Visible` unless the player’s right mouse button is down.

Note that, if the mouse is locked, `UserInputService/InputChanged` will still fire when the player moves the mouse and will pass in the Delta that the mouse attempted to move by. Additionally, if the player is kicked from the game, the mouse will be forcefully unlocked.

This property does not affect the movement of the mouse icon. Nor does it affect the *Camera Sensitivity* setting found in the *Settings* tab of the client’s *Settings* menu, which also adjusts the sensitivity of events tracking mouse movement.

This property has a maximum value of 10 and a minimum value of 0. A lower value corresponds to lower sensitivity, and a higher value to higher sensitivity.

When sensitivity is 0, events that track the mouse’s movement will still fire but all parameters and properties indicating the change in mouse position will return `DataType/Vector2|Vector2.new()`, or `DataType/Vector3|Vector3.new()` in the case of `InputObject/Delta|InputObject.Delta`.

| Enum.KeyCode.DPadLeft<     |
| Enum.KeyCode.DPadRight<    |
| Enum.KeyCode.DPadUp<       |
| Enum.KeyCode.DPadDown<     |

This can be used to check whether a specific button, such as A, is being held down. For example:

```lua
local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

local button = Enum.KeyCode.ButtonA
local gamepad = Enum.UserInputType.Gamepad1

local isButtonHeld = UserInputService:IsGamepadButtonDown(gamepad, button)
```

A device’s gravity vector represent the force of gravity on each of the device’s X, Y, and Z axes. While gravity never changes, the force it exerts on each axis changes when the device rotates and changes orientation. The force value exerted on each axis is a unit vector ranging from -1 to 1.

An accelerometer is a component found in most mobile devices that measures acceleration (change in speed).

This event can be used to determine the real-world direction of the force of gravity on a user’s device. This even can then be used to simulate the force of gravity on a user’s device within the game, such as on in-game objects (see example below).

To check if a user’s device has an enabled accelerometer, see `UserInputService/AccelerometerEnabled`. If the device has an enabled accelerometer, you can use the `UserInputService/GetDeviceGravity` function to get the current force of gravity on the user’s device. */

This event fires whenever the user tries to make their `Player/Character` jump. Default behavior responds to a jump request by setting the player’s `Humanoid/Jump` property to true, which makes the player’s character jump.

The event can be used to track every time a player wants to jump. Instead of using it to make a player jump, this should be used to change default jump behavior - such as disabling jumping.

For example, the code below prints “Jump” every time the player sends a jump request.

```lua
local userInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

function jumpRequest()
    print("Jump!")
end

userInputService.JumpRequest:Connect(JumpRequest)
```

Since this event fires multiple times for a single jump request, using a [debounce](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Debounce) is suggested.

If you would like to connect keys or buttons to other actions, consider using events such as `UserInputService/GetKeysPressed` and `UserInputService/InputBegan` or the `ContextActionService`.

This event can be used to determine when a user stops touching the screen of their device. It can be paired with `UserInputService/TouchStarted` to determine when a user starts and stops touching the screen.

For example, the code below prints the screen position where the user stops touching the screen.

```lua
local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

function TouchEnded(touch, gameProcessedEvent)
	print("Touch ended at "..tostring(touch.Position))

To retrieve the `DataType/CFrame` of a connected VR device, use `UserInputService/GetUserCFrame`.

As the event fires locally, it can only be used in a `LocalScript`.
